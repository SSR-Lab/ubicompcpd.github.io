					<h2>Bridging the Gap between Networking and Transportation: from Retro-reflective Roadway to High-speed Railway</h2>
					<h2>Abstract</h2>
					<p class="lead">The increasing mobility supported by today’s highway and high-speed railway infrastructure has significantly improved our short-to-medium transportation efficiency. However, such extreme high mobility also poses great challenges in providing ubiquitous and reliable connectivity between host vehicles and the rest of the world for driving safety, Internet access, etc. In this talk, I will introduce two examples of my research to address these challenges. First, I will present RetroI2V, a novel retroreflective infrastructure-to-vehicle communication and networking system that renovates conventional road signs to convey additional and dynamic information to vehicles while reduces the power and cost by 100x and 10x in comparison to current V2X solutions. Second, I will introduce Polycorn, a data-driven multipath transmission middleware solution that observes the sophisticated cross-layer interaction pattern between mobile and basestation and takes advantage of carrier diversity to optimize short flow latency. Experimental results from “Fuxing Hao” high-speed trains on the Beijing-Shanghai HSR route deployment show Polycorn can effectively benefit onboard passengers’ mobile experience. I will conclude the talk with future directions in extreme high mobility data networking research, both in terms of the core methods as well as applications.</p>
