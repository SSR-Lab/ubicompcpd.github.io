                    <p class="lead">
                        Human behavior prediction, including both the physical-world mobility and activities and cyber space web browsing, are critically important for ubiquitous computing system. The performance of prediction greatly depends on the quantity and `quality' of data. In real-world systems, collecting such data reflecting human behavior can be costly or impossible due to practical limitations. We address this problem by leveraging a key insight – people’s intention behind their behavior is highly correlated with the nearby point of interests (PoI), which are the crowd sourcing labels accounts for the function of city regions and intentions of human activities. In this talk, we first present the first population-level, city-scale prediction of application usage on smartphones by developing a technique that leverages transfer learning to predict which applications are most popular and estimate the whole usage distribution based on the POI information of that particular location. Then, we introduce how to using POI as the knowledge to predict human mobility behaviors from both the individual and crowd level. Our findings pave the way for predicting which apps are relevant to users, and how they move given their current location with the physical knowledge of POI.
